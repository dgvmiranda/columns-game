# Project Description
This project is part of the Object-Oriented Programming (PCO) course for the Bachelor of Information Technologies for the academic year 2022/2023. The final objective of the project is to apply the knowledge acquired in the classes through the development of a puzzle game inspired by Columns, a game created in 1989.

## Game Context
In the game Columns, the player interacts with a rectangular area composed of 240 positions, distributed over 20 rows and 12 columns. Pieces composed of three different symbols fall from the top until they reach the bottom of the area or other pieces already positioned. The player can move the piece left or right and change the order of the symbols.
